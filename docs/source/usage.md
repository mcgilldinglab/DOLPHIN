## Installation

### üß† Platform Notes

**Note:** This tool has been primarily tested on Linux-based systems, specifically Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS. While it may run on other platforms, we recommend using a **Linux environment** for best compatibility and performance, especially for memory-intensive preprocessing steps such as **STAR** or **Cell Ranger** alignment.

>‚ö†Ô∏è **macOS users:** DOLPHIN is also compatible with macOS (Tested on macOS Ventura 13.0.1 with Apple M1, and Sequoia 15.3.2 with Apple M2 Pro), but **GPU acceleration is not supported** because CUDA is unavailable on this platform. All computations will run in **CPU-only mode**.

### üçé Option 2: macOS Installation (CPU-only)
Other steps are the same as in the Linux installation. Only Step 2 differs.
```bash
conda env create -f environment_mac.yaml
conda activate DOLPHIN
```
