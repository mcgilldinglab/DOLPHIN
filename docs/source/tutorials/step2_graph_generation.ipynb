    "# Generate Feature Matrix and Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate the **feature matrix** and **adjacency matrix** using the raw exon read counts and raw junction read counts obtained from the count files. For detailed instructions on aligning the RNA-seq data, refer to the following tutorials:\n",

    "- **Full-length RNA-seq**: [step1_1_preprocess_full_length.md](./step1_1_preprocess_full_length.md)\n",

    "Before running this section, please ensure that your counts data and metadata file is ready, and also make sure you have the `dolphin_adj_index.csv` and `dolphin.exon.pkl` files prepared. These files can be generated in this [file](./step0_generate_exon_gtf_final.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Note:** These two files are paired — the `.pkl` file contains exon-level information, and the `dolphin_adj_index.csv` stores adjacency location data.  \n",

    "### Metadata File Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata file should be tab-separated, with the **\"CB\"** (cell barcode) column as the only mandatory column. You can add as many metadata columns as needed. These additional metadata columns will be retained in all output `adata` files as **obs** (observations).\n",

    "- The **\"CB\"** column is mandatory as it represents the cell barcode.\n",
    "- Additional columns (e.g., **cluster**, **source**, etc.) can be added based on the specific metadata required for your analysis.\n",
    "- These metadata columns will be included in the output `adata` files under **obs**.\n",
    "- **\"CB\"** will be used to find the **count table file names** and will be stored as **obs index** in `adata`."
